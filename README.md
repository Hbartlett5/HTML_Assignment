For this assignment, I was tasked with demonstrating my understanding of HTML by creating a new document that included a navigation bar, a form for the user to fill out, a table of products, and a picture.

The navigation bar allows the user to easily get to the Home, About, and Contact sections of the website.

The form for the user to fill out was done as a table set to make storing the information together easier. The information includes name, email, and a "How did you find out about us?" question. 

The table of products is laid out to include the product name, price, and quantity. There are three example products given on the website to showcase the table better.

Lastly, the picture is placed as an example of what it could look like to have a picture of the products beneath the table. The picture was rounded using the style feature.

Each section within the code is separated and labeled neatly for easier reading and navigation. The bonus content is also labeled quick identification.
